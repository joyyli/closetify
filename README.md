## Motivation

Choosing what to wear isn't always easy. We often forget what's in the back of our closets, and with the allure of fast fashion, can overlook what we already own for clothes we see in advertisements.

## Overview

Closetify is a web app that helps users have a better understanding of what's in their closet and available to them. Users can plan and build their daily outfits within the app.

## Features
### Personal closet
Users can upload images of their clothes into Closetify, populating a personal closet. Clothes can be tagged by occasion and weather, allowing filtering to find specific styles.

### Outfit maker
Built with Konva and React, users can drag, drop, transform, and rotate their closet items on a canvas to plan their daily outfits, which are then saved to their home feed. Outfits are saved to Firebase's realtime databse.
